# üìñ Description

A small prototype to analyze unstructured text using an LLM, producing:

- **1‚Äì2 sentence summary**
- **Structured metadata**: title, topics, sentiment, keywords
- **Confidence score**

Users can analyze text and search past analyses by topic or keyword.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the App
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

# üì¶ Deliverables

- **Setup and Run Instructions**  
(See [Setup](SETUP.md) for details.)

# ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs

- **Time Constraints**: Due to the 2-hour timebox, advanced features like authentication, pagination, and Docker setup were not included.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented a basic, rule-based approach instead of a sophisticated ML model.  
- **Error Handling**: Minimal ‚Äî enough to catch empty input and mock API failures, but not fully production-grade.
